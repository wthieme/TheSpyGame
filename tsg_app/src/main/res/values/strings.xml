    <string name="RulesTxt"><b><i>The Spy Game</i></b> is a fun game for 3 to 9 players.
        \n\nOne of the players is the <b>spy</b> and the others have to guess who that is.
        \nThe <b>spy</b> on the other hand has to guess where the other players are situated.
        \nThis is done by asking questions to each other. Player 1 asks a question to player 2 and when player 2 has answered, it\'s his turn to ask a question.
        \nA player is not allowed to ask a question to the player that asked the question in the previous turn.
        \nCreate a game with the \'<b>plus</b>\' button, then when all players are joined (\'<b>join</b>\' button) press the \'<b>play</b>\' button.
        \nTo <b>chat</b> to another player press the button with the player name in it or use the \'<b>chat</b>\' button.
        \n\nThere is a <b>time limit</b> for each round. After the game has been started a countdown counter shows the playing time left.
        \n\nWhen the counter reaches <b>00:00</b> it\'s time to speak out.
