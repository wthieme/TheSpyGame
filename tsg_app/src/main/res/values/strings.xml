    <string name="RulesTxt"><b><i>The Spy Game</i></b> is a fun game for 3 to 9 players.
        \n\nIf you have a Chromecast, the first thing you should do is push the cast button. The status of the game will be displayed on your TV!
        \n\nIn \'The Spy Game\', one of the players is the <b>spy</b> and the others have to guess who that is.
        \nThe <b>spy</b> on the other hand has to guess where the other players are situated.
        \n\nThis is done by asking questions to each other. Player 1 asks a question to player 2 and when player 2 has answered, it\'s his turn to ask a question.
        \nA player is not allowed to ask a question to the player that asked the question in the previous turn.
        \n\nTo create a game, use the \'<b>plus</b>\' button, then when all players are joined (\'<b>join</b>\' button) press the \'<b>play</b>\' button to start.
        \n\nAny player who thinks he knows the answer can finish the game with the \'<b>finish</b>\' button.
        \n\nTo <b>chat</b> to another player press the button with the player name in it or use the \'<b>chat</b>\' button.
        \n\nThere is a <b>time limit</b> for each round. After the game has been started a countdown counter shows the playing time left.
        \n\nWhen the counter reaches <b>00:00</b> or someone has ended the game it\'s time to speak out.
        \nYou have 30 seconds to answer. Each correct answers earns you 1 point.
